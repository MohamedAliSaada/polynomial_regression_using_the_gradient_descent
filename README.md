# polynomial_regression_using_the_gradient_descent
This repository contains a Python implementation of a polynomial regression model using gradient descent. The model predicts `Y` from `X` based on a polynomial function, and the implementation includes data preprocessing, normalization, cost function evaluation, and convergence analysis.
